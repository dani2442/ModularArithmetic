# ModularArithmetic
This project pretends to unified every function that you will use in a cryptography program.

## Getting Started
You will find in the file: main.cpp example of every function that is implemented in this library.

###Functions

- Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Bezout solver
- Decomposition number algorithm
- Eulerâ€™s totient function
- a^{b}(mod\:m)
- Primality Test
- Find next Prime
- Inverse function
- Solver for 1 equation
- Solver for multiple equations
