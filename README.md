# Modular Arithmetic Library in **C++**
This project pretends to unified every function that you will use in a cryptography program.

## Getting Started
You will find in the file: main.cpp example of every function that is implemented in this library.
There is a description of each function in dprogrammer website. 

[Modular Arithmetic documentation](http://dprogrammer.org/modular-arithmetic-library)

[Modular Arithmetic article](http://dprogrammer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/modularArithmetic.pdf)

### Functions

- Great Common Divisor (GCD)
- Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Bezout solver
- Decomposition number algorithm
- Euler’s totient function
- a^{b}(mod\:m)
- Primality Test
- Find next Prime
- Inverse function
- Solver for 1 equation
- Solver for multiple equations

## Cryptography
This library is used to implement most powerful algorithms for encrypting and decrpyting. (this part is currently under development)
- Additive
- Multiplicative
- ~~Exponential~~
- ~~RSA~~
- ~~Elliptic curves~~
